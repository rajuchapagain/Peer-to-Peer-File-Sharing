# Peer-to-Peer-File-Sharing
The application is developed to demonstrate the distributed file/message sharing. Multicast socket is heavily used to distribute same message among the peers in group. Similarly, client server communication using TCP socket is used to share the resource directly via socket. The application uses the concept of both client server communication and multicast message broadcasting service. Each peer joining multicast group will have unique id and send the message to each member of the group. Each group member except the requesting peer will check if they hold the requested resource and share file via socket. The requesting peer will check the input stream in the TCP socket and download the resource if available.
